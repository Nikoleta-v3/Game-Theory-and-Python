# Summary

Game Theory and Python is an open source, educational tutorial aimed to
introduce readers to game theory and more specifically to repeated games. The
tutorial uses the open source library called [Axelrod-Python](https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod)
integrated with Jupyter Notebooks, making this an open source, reproducible and
interactive tutorial.

# Statement of Need

Game theory is a field of applied mathematics and an essential tool for
understanding the outcome of situations where agents with different behaviours
interact. A real life example of such situation is people choosing to behave in
a selfish or selfless manner when they interact with others.  

In 1950, this very interaction was formulated in a two players game known as the
prisoner's dilemma (PD).  The PD attracted the attention of the scientific
community in the 1980s when a political scientist called R. Axelrod decided to
run a computer tournament. In his tournament strategic rules, written in the
form of computer code, would repeatedly choose between selfish and selfless
actions while having memory of the previous interactions. The tournament was a
success and researchers still remember the winning strategy, Tit for Tat.
Axelrod's work spawn to life a new research field that is still active and
achieves over 60 publications per year. An open source packaged the
Axelrod-Python was created in order to reproduce Axelrod's work as well as other
ongoing research work on the topic. Axelrod-Python  is an exceptional open
source package which follows best practices and has created a large active
community.

This tutorial serves as an introduction to the iterated prisoner’s dilemma and
the notion of strategic rules. Following the tutorial will not only allow
readers to reproduce  Axelrod’s original tournaments but also to created their
own unique tournaments by selecting strategies from a list of more than 200
ones.

Composing an idea for a new strategy is not an easy task, however, contributing
to the Axelrod-Python package can be. The tutorials allows readers to work on
their own ideas and implement them in Python code. The  strategies then can be
placed in different tournaments in order to access their success and weakness.

The overall aim of the tutorial is not only to introduce readers to a unique and
essential field of applied mathematics. It is also to allow them to  construct
their very own ideas using their Python skills and in a way participate in a
tournament such as that run by Axelrod back in the 1980. The PD, and
subsequently this tutorial, allows readers to try and tackle one of the most
questioned questions since Darwin's time; how can someone be  the dominant
player in world where we interact with others.

# Recent Uses

This tutorial was originally formulated to run a game theory workshop at
[PyCon Namibia 2017](https://na.pycon.org/pycon-namibia-2017/).
It has attracted attention of the community ever since and has been used to various
others events.

# Acknowledgements

The tutorial has been made possible due the existence of the open source package
[Axelrod-Python](https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod).
I would like to express my appreciation to the main contributors of
the package as well as anyone that has ever contributed to it.
I would also like to thank my PhD advisor, Dr Vincent Knight, for double checking
the material and for running the workshop with me.
